This dataset 📊 provides insights into factors influencing hiring decisions. Each record represents a candidate with various attributes considered during the hiring process. 

I used three models with imbalanced, oversampling, and undersampling data, and evaluated them using the F1 score metric.
With these models, we can get an idea of whether a candidate is good or not.👌
